## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We appreciate your enthusiasm and support. Currently, we are actively working on developing comprehensive contributing guidelines to ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process.

**Note:** At this moment, we cannot guarantee that we will process pull requests or issues, as we are still establishing the workflow and guidelines that will make it easier for everyone to participate in the project. We understand the importance of community involvement and want to create an inclusive and comfortable environment for all contributors.

Rest assured, as soon as the contributing guide is ready, we will be more than happy to welcome your contributions and address any issues you may encounter. We'll make an announcement when the guidelines are finalized and open for contributions.

In the meantime, we encourage you to explore the project, familiarize yourself with the codebase, and provide feedback or suggestions that will be valuable during this development phase.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We look forward to your future contributions once the contributing guidelines are in place!
