## Common information for all calculation cases

Each case of calculation finds epoch when Lido can finalize requests, but finalization happens during Accounting Oracle report and it happens in exact reference slot. Here are examples of reference slots for different networks: mainnet - 12:00:04 UTC, goerli - 05:28:00 UTC, holesky - each 2 hours.

### Calculate next report time

- calculation of epoch of next frame of report:
  `epochOfNextReport = initialEpoch + nextFrame * epochsPerFrame`
- `initialEpoch` and `epochsPerFrame` are from `accountingOracleHashConsensus` contract [getFrameConfig](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/hash-consensus#getframeconfig) method

### Gap before next report

- Withdrawal requests which are close to report (`getRequestTimestampMargin`) will not be in closest report, will be postponed to the next one if they are in that gap before report.
- `OracleReportSanityChecker` contract, get `limits.requestTimestampMargin` from [getOracleReportLimits](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/oracle-report-sanity-checker#getoraclereportlimits)

### Gap after report

- it takes time to proceed report it usually it can take 20-30 min. But in emergency cases there is possibility that report wonâ€™t happen in current frame, but possibility is very low and it happened only around 5 time in history.


### The sequence of searching for a first suitable case from following cases is:

1. `bunker` mode is active.
2. `buffer` or `vaultsBalance` has enough funds.
3.  select minimum frame from the following three cases of `rewardOnly`, *`validatorBalances`* or *`exitValidators`.*

## Case if there is enough tokens in buffer + withdrawals vaults for withdrawal:

If next sources of tokens has enough funds for current request + all others unfinalized requests before this request, we can withdrawal tokens without exit validators process.

- lido buffer from [method](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido#getbufferedether)
- balance of [WithdrawalVaults](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-vault) and [ExecutionLayerRewardsVault](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido-execution-layer-rewards-vault)

## Case of rewards only

Based on rewards from previous report we can consider this number as approximate future rewards. Formula to get epoch

`onlyRewardPotentialEpoch = unfinalized / rewardsPerEpoch`

where `unfinalized` is current request + all requests before it.

## Case of validators with withdrawable epoch

We can find Lido validators which is already in process of withdrawal and group them by `withdrawable_epoch` to `frameBalances`, then we can find frame and return it.

---

## Case if there is NOT enough tokens for withdrawal:

- We are going to calculate how much reports should be proceeded to fulfil current withdrawal
- Basic target is to find epoch for exit all needed validators
- Find epoch by this formula: `unfinalizedStethe / (32eth * churnLimit + rewardsPerEpoch)`
- `rewardsPerEpoch` calculation can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@lido/r1fau3aJ3?type=view#Predict-available-ETH-before-next-withdrawn)
- And last thing to count is `sweepingMean`.  More information can be found [here](https://consensys.net/shanghai-capella-upgrade/) in *Full Withdrawal Process* chapter*.* Shortly it is minimum 256 epoch (27.3 hour). But we use middle value which is 567 epoch (depending on total validators number). **
- Next find next frame after found epoch potential epoch
- No gap before report but gap after report still exists

## [Under development] Case of bunker active

We check if bunker is active in contract [here](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#isbunkermodeactive) and predict that finalization will be in approximately 14 frames as constant if there are no associated slashings. More about bunker more [here](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/oracle-spec/accounting-oracle/#bunker-mode-activation).
