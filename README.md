## Withdrawals API

The Withdrawals API offers an utility for estimating the waiting time for [withdrawals](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide#withdrawals-unsteth) within the Lido protocol on Ethereum.

This service is helpful for stakers, providing insights from the moment of withdrawal request [placement](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#request) to its [finalization](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#finalization).

### Use Cases

- Estimation Before Request: Users can estimate the waiting time before placing a withdrawal request.
- Tracking: Users can track the estimated waiting time for an already placed request.

Detailed explanation of the estimation algorithm is available [here](how-estimation-works.md).

## Release flow

To create a new release:

1. Merge all changes to the `main` branch.
1. After the merge, the `Prepare release draft` action will run automatically. When the action is complete, a release draft is created.
1. When you need to release, go to Repo â†’ Releases.
1. Publish the desired release draft manually by clicking the edit button - this release is now the `Latest Published`.
1. After publication, the action to create a release bump will be triggered automatically.
